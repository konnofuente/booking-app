## Installation and Launching a React Project

Follow the instructions below to install and launch a new React project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Step 1: Install Create-React-App

Create-React-App is a command-line utility by Facebook that helps in creating React.js projects. Navigate to your desired directory and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Replace `my-app` with your desired project name.

### Step 2: Navigate into the project directory

After the project has been created, navigate into the project directory by typing:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Again, replace `my-app` with your project name.

### Step 3: Start the React application

Finally, inside the project directory, start the React application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Your application will now be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Note:** The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You'll see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

Happy Coding!
